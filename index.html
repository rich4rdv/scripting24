          <div class="col-sm-8  "><h1>Where it Started?</h1>
            <br><p>I've always been a curious kid. So when I look at somethin that someone made, I wonder how I could it. I always challenge myself to learn new things. I was 12 years old when I first opened up photoshop in my home computer.
                I was so confused at first but then I got the hang of it. My first works were all.... you know, right? Since then, I watched youtube videos, learned from other artists and experimented some styles by myself.

            <h1>How it's Going?</h1>
            <br><p>I'm currently pursuing a diploma in Multimedia Production at Lethbridge Polytechnic,Alberta. Even while trying build up my own brand and freelancing as well, I'm also looking for jobs around me to get some more exposure and build up my skill set. 
                My plan always is to be an entrepreneur, to start something on my own from scratch and grow it like nothing else. And I'm really hopeful that the cours I'm taking helps me get there.
